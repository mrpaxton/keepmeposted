Keep me posted on relevant news from newsapi.org

## How it works:
KeepMePosted is a web app that fetches news from the News API to gather articles from sources such as TechCrunch, Bloomberg, and ESPN. 
 
For TechCrunch articles, the web app analyzes and ranks relevant key phrases utilizing the RAKE machine learning algorithm.  It then data visualizes those relevant phrases.  It also displays related topics of this news.  The users can gain some insights about the topics without going through the news.

- [x] Service using Crons job
- [x] Web scraping to gather info and build own database
- [x] Frontend material-ui components with data visualization
